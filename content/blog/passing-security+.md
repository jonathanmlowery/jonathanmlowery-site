## Exam Objectives PDF

The foundation was CompTIA's official exam objectives PDF. I downloaded it and made sure I could explain every bullet point using the Feynman technique.

The Security+ covers a lot of content, but CompTIA does make it pretty easy for your to know when you are ready. Looking over the exam objectives and tyring to explain each bullet point will show you where your knowledge gaps are. If you can solidly explain each objective, you'll do just fine on the exam.

## Professor Messer's Course

Professor Messer's YouTube series was my main video resource. The playlist covers the entire exam objectives, with clear explanations.

I watched the course, taking notes on new material. Since there was overlap with Network+, I skipped familiar parts. For unfamiliar concepts like encryption algorithms and authentication protocols, I researched further via Google, making sure to use reliable sources.

Professor Messer is the GOAT.

## Andrew Ramdayal Practice Questions

Practice is key. Andrew Ramdayal's video has 50 questions with explanations.

I took the quiz and scored 46/50 before the exam. Reviewing mistakes solidified weak areas, like risk management for me. Taking practice tests with questions similar to the real exam is also especially helpful for people who haven't had the joy of taking a CompTIA exam before. Being able to quickly figure out the answers to their scenario-based questions is very important.

## My Strategy and Tips

- **Study Plan**: 3-4 weeks, 2-3 hours daily. Focus on a video course first, then reviewing objectives, then practice questions.
- **Leverage Overlap**: Network+ helped with networking concepts, so I spent less time there.
- **Feynman Technique**: Explaining objectives simply to identify your knowledge gaps.
- **Exam Day**: Stay calm, read questions carefully. CompTIA questions may seem unclear, but there is almost always a hint or two telling you what answer they want.
